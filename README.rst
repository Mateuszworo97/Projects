Apiary Water Dispensing System - This is a device design whose purpose is to automatically supply bee water from an underground tank.
In hard-to-reach places and with limited access to fresh water.
The system's task is also to display current data regarding time, temperature and light intensity on the display.
The system will enable the pump to be turned on at a specific time for a specific period of time.

In the future, this project will be developed with additional functionalities.



Current operation and functionalities
------------


The system measures time, temperature, humidity and light intensity. The data is shown on the display.
By default, the pump is turned on for 1 minute. Every hour.
Using push buttons, we can increase the pump activation time from 1 to 59 minutes.
Using the buttons, we can also change the time at which the alarm will turn on (pump on).
The next time the alarm will turn on will be increased by the hour value displayed on the display.
we can delay the pump activation value from 1 to 16.
